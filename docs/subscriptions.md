# Subscribe and unsubscribe feature

## Concept

Subscriptions on **Detecctor** are similar to the pub-sub architecture, well, sort of. The basic idea is to subscribe to
messages, sent by the client without prior request (scheduled monitoring events).

## Command structure

The first command is the `/sub` or `/subscribe` command. The subscribe command is structured as:

```text
/sub nodes=exampleNode1,exampleNode2 commands=/auth,/get_status notifyInterval=1
```

The order of the arguments is insignificant, since they are **key-value** arguments. The `commands` key specifies the
command, which will be monitored on the specified node. You can monitor multiple commands by passing the value as a
comma-separated list. If the `commands` key is missing, all the commands from the node will be monitored.

The `nodes` key specifies which node to listen to. You can specify multiple nodes by passing the value as
comma-separated list. If the `nodes` key is not specified, a command or list of commands will be listened to on all the
nodes.

The `notifyInterval` key is used to periodically notify the user about the last known result of the command that was
sent to the server. The interval is in minutes. If the `notifyInterval` key is not specified, the server will
automatically notify the user about the command immediately after receiving it.
